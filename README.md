Diagnostic Modality Connect API (DMCAPI)
========================================

The Diagnostic Modality Connect API (DMCAPI) is a focused subset of the Diagnostic Modality Integrator (DMI) project, designed to be directly consumed by healthcare providers and practices. This API provides endpoints and data structures to:

 
 *   Interrogate diagnostic services
 *   Create and manage diagnostic orders
 *   Retrieve diagnostic results
 *   Manage event subscriptions related to diagnostics
 

Purpose
-------

The DMCAPI exists to streamline the integration of diagnostic modalities within and between healthcare IT systems. By offering a simplified interface that includes only the essential endpoints, the DMCAPI ensures that developers can quickly and efficiently incorporate diagnostic functionalities into their applications without the overhead of unrelated features.
 

Target Audience
---------------

This API is intended for:
 
 *   Healthcare providers
 *   Medical practices
 *   Healthcare IT developers 
 

Why Use DMCAPI?
---------------
 
*   **Compatibility**: Highly compatible with the DMI, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.
*   **Simplicity**: Focused endpoints make it easier to implement and maintain and encourage adoption by healthcare providers and software developers.
*   **Efficiency**: Directly addresses the needs of healthcare providers by including only the most relevant functionalities.
*   **Open Source**: Benefit from an open-source project with community support and contributions.
*   **Standardization**: Adopting a standard API reduces the need to write custom connections between different vendors, promoting consistency and interoperability across systems.   
*   **Permissive Licensing**: Both the DMI and this subset of DMI are permissively licensed, making them easy to adopt and integrate into practice software and diagnostic modalities.
